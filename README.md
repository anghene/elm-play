My playful adventures with [elm-lang](http://github.com/elm-lang.git)
I am following some online courses trying to learn the Basics of Elm while playing around with some ideas of my own in the meantime.

Some resources I recommend for Elm Beginners are:

## Online Courses

1. #### [Elm For Beginners](http://courses.knowthen.com/p/elm-for-beginners) FREE Course

   You can follow with the Companion Repo can be found at: (https://github.com/knowthen/elm)

## Books

0. [Elm's very own guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org) is Ground 0 for your learning of Elm.

1. [Manning's](http://manning.com) [Elm in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action) by [Richard Feldman](http://twitter.com/rtfeldman) is just the right stuff !

2. [ElmProgramming.com](http://elmprogramming.com) by [Pawan Poudel](https://github.com/pawanpoudel) seems to shine some insightful stuff.

Feel free to fork and contribute your own resources.
